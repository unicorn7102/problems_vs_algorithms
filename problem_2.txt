Under the hood we are running the binary search on a sorted array, which is possibly rotated. 
The only difference from standard binary search is, each step when we divide the array by half 
and decide which path to go down (left or right), we need to check whether there is a rotate happening, 
in addition to comparing the target with the mid value. 
However, the check should have constant time complexity, so overall the algorithm still has 
time complexity of $O(log(n))$.
The space complexity is $O(log(n))$ because recursion is used here and extra space is needed for 
holding a call stack of size $O(log(n))$.
