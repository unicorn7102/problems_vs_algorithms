It is natural to choose the binary search algorithm, which has time complexity of $O(log(n))$ for this problem, because 1) the array to be searched is naturally sorted, which contains the consective numbers from 0 to the target number; 2) searching for a squared root of a number essentially has no difference from searching for the target number itself: we simply need to do a square calculation in each comparison.
