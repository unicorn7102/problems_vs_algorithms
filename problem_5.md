The time complexity of adding a word or checking for word existence is constant with respect to the number of words already added to the Trie ($n$); it only increases linearly with the length of the word being added or searched. The time taken for autocompleting is determined by number of added words having the input prefix and the (average) lengths of these words ($m$). Assuming that $m<<n$, the worst-case time complexity for autocompletion is $O(n)$.
